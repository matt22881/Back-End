^When creating an entry it will not show in get routes without at least 1 rating. To subvert this bug each entry is initialized with a rating of 0. This rating is created by the author of the entry. So if a user is viewing his/her own entry and goes to rate their own entry it must update the rating and not try to make a new one.
